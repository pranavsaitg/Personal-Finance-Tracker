# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Using Python, I designed a basic Personal Finance Tracker

I mainly did this project to gain a basic understanding of python syntax and how python programming is applied in a project.

And so, I commented a lot of my code, to help me understand what each line of code was doing and how it is all working in tandem.

To create this, I used a Tutorial by Tech With Tim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn1EjhcQk64&amp;ab_channel=TechWithTim

I aim to add more onto this project in the future, to turn it in a real resume-type of project.
